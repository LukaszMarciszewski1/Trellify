# Task Manager With MERN Stack

#### This project is an educational project that I have implemented. It is a clone of the popular Trello application with an additional functionality for managing a warehouse.

The aim of the project was to improve my skills in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and to use additional tools and libraries such as JWT token, AWS S3, and Redux Toolkit.

During the project, I used JWT token for user authentication, AWS S3 for storing product images, and Redux Toolkit for managing the application state. The application allows adding, browsing, editing, and deleting cards, as well as other basic functionalities found in the Trello application.
